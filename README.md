# Visit The Suffolk Coast
Visit the Suffolk coast is a site which aims to give the user more information about their potential visit to the Suffolk Coast.
This website hopes to entise new travelers into the idea of expoloring this beautiful part of the United Kingdom. We aim to give helpful information about the area, so that it can be explored properly.
The languages which are used on this project are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Bootstrap has also been used alongside these languages to help the project has a clear structure and is also responsive depending on the screen size the user is using.

### Wireframes
The Wireframes for this project were created on WireframePro. I spent a good amount of time moving around the content to see what will work the best for the look and feel of the website. The images of my wireframes are below.

### Design
The colours that I have chosen for this project are to help the user feel at ease and to not be to in your face. The colours have also been chosen to reflect the Suffolk Coast natural colours.
I have been aiming to showcase some of the colours that the user may see and feel if they were to ever visit the Suffolk coast.

The colours I used were: 
* #f9f9f9 - Snow was used for the background
* #041414 - Dark Green has been used for the text
* #00A3A3 - Persian Green has been used for the buttons

The main colour used for the background colours, navbar and footer is called Snow and this has been used to keep consistency and to also reflect how the Suffolk Coast sky looks like. I also choose this colour as it has given the site a subtle but classy colour scheme as well as allowing the text to be easily read.
The navbar has a default colour set to Snow, but for the purpose of the images on the landing page and contact us page those navbars are transparent. This is so that the user can see the image within that page clearly.
