# Visit The Suffolk Coast
Visit the Suffolk coast is a site which aims to give the user more information about their potential visit to the Suffolk Coast.
This website hopes to entise new travelers into the idea of expoloring this beautiful part of the United Kingdom. We aim to give helpful information about the area, so that it can be explored properly.
The languages which are used on this project are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Bootstrap has also been used alongside these languages to help the project has a clear structure and is also responsive depending on the screen size the user is using.



### Wireframes
The Wireframes for this project were created on WireframePro. I spent a good amount of time moving around the content to see what will work the best for the look and feel of the website. The images of my wireframes are below.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The colours that I have chosen for this project are to help the user feel at ease and to not be to in your face. The colours have also been chosen to reflect the Suffolk Coast natural colours.
I have been aiming to showcase some of the colours that the user may see and feel if they were to ever visit the Suffolk coast.

The colours I used were: 
* #f9f9f9 - Snow was used for the background
* #041414 - Dark Green has been used for the text
* #00A3A3 - Persian Green has been used for the buttons

The main colour used for the background colours, navbar and footer is called Snow and this has been used to keep consistency and to also reflect how the Suffolk Coast sky looks like. I also choose this colour as it has given the site a subtle but classy colour scheme as well as allowing the text to be easily read.
The navbar has a default colour set to Snow, I feel that by doing that the site continues to have a consist theme. 
I feel that using a Dark Green colour on the text, gives the text a bit of a pop and is well contrasted with the Snow. The colour choice allows the user to read clearly and is not put off by in your face colours. 
The persian Green has been used for the buttons to give the site just a little pop of colour, but not so much that it doesnt look like it belongs. This is a similar colour to the vegetation you may find on a Suffolk Beach. 

I have used this style to keep the website looking clean and consistent, so that the user does not feel like they need to leave the site because the colours are to overwhelming. 

#### Fonts

For this website I have only used two fonts throughtout, those fonts are 'Cinzel' for all headings and Brand on the navbar and 'Lato' for all other text. 'Cinzel has been used to create a classy feel to the site, but also to be readable, 'Lato' was chosen for its simple look and feel. 'Lato' is also very readable and attractive and compliments 'Cinzel' well. 
Both of these fonts are being applied by Google Fonts API and have a fallback of 'Sans Serif'. These fonts have given this website a classy and sophisticated look and feel, which is user friendly and in-keeping with images and style of the Suffolk Coast that I am trying to represent.

#### Display 

I have been very cautious to keep this site clean and simple on the eye, as this reflects the Suffolk Coast atmosphere and culture. The hero image on the landing page has been chosen as it is showing a lovely beach on the Suffolk Coast, this is similar for the image on the contact page. The image is of a boat which is on Aldeburgh beach, and is a good selling point for potential tourists. 
The content on this site has been centered to keep the flow and feel consistent, but also appealing. To give the user more of an idea of how the Suffolk Coast looks I have added videos within the landing page and also the planning page and these are responsive and keep the website looking modern and clean. The content is all full width, this is to make sure that the user never has to squint to see what is on the page. 

## Features
#### Existing Features

* Navbar - Users can use the links on the left to navigate between all pages on the website. These links also collapse down into a hamburger icon at smaller screen sizes. The navbar is featured on all the pages within this site. The logo is also a link which when clicked will take the user back to the home page.

* Hero Images - I have two hero images within the site, one of them is on the home page and the other is located within the contact us page. Both of these images are of Suffolk Coast Beaches, they cover the full width of the page. The image within contact us page covers full width and height of the screen.

* Home Page - This page is designed to give a little information to the user about the Suffolk Coast, the site also has videos embedded to show the user what the Suffolk Coast looks like in the different seasons. When the users lands on the home page there is a button which asks them to start planning, this button when clicked will take the user to the Plan-Your-Visit.HTML page on which the interactive map sits. 

* Plan your visit page - This is the page with more information about the area and has an interactive map which shows the user different areas of which they may want to visit. This page is made up from an interactive map that is using Google Maps API to load the places and place markers, a group of cards with small information about some towns on the Suffolk Coast which have buttons to take the user to other websites which have greater information. To finish up there is another video showing Aldeburgh to give the user a taste of one of the towns. At the bottom of the page there is a button to take the user back to the map with a click. 

* Contact Page - This page has a form for the user to fill out to be able to contact us with any questions that they may have. This form uses emailjs to send the completed form information off to the website owner. On completion the user will see a pop up which reads 'Email has successfully sent', this important as the user will know that their question has been sent to the owner and they will be able to wait for an response.

* Videos - The videos have been carefully selected and placed so that they fit in best with the flow of each page and make sense to the user when they find them.

#### Future Features

* I would love to add more detailed information to the markers within the map, so that they show information about the place selected and an image.
* Within the Plan Your Visit page, it would be great to have an option for the user to see what the typical weather would be like at time in the year that they selected. 
* On the the home page, I would like to have a small Suffolk to English dictionary so that the user can have something to look at which is humourous.

## Testing

Testing this site has been completed by using W3C Validators and JShint for all the code. I did not use Jasmine as an automatic testing, as I did not feel confident in my knowledge of using Jasmine correctly. 

### W3C Validators
I used [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) on all of my code to make sure there were no errors within the project. Throughtout my project I have run my code through these validators, to make sure it is all error free.

### JShint
[JShint](https://jshint.com/) is the validator I have used for all of my JavaScript code, I used it to help me look for potential bugs and errors within my code. The validator came back with some ES6(use 'esversion: 6') issues, according to my mentor and tutor support these can be overlooked. This is because template literals are a better way to code, which is also cleaner and easier to read.

### DEV Tools
Google Chrome DevTools has been extremely helpful to see where I may have gone wrong but also where I have got it right.

* I was able to use to figure out why one of my videos was changing the responsiveness of my home page, because of the DevTools I was able to correct that. 
* In the early stages of my JavaScript coding for my map, I was able to see what issues I had within my code by looking at the console and using console.log within my code to show up the information needed.
* I have been able to check the responsiveness of each page on my site within the DevTools at different screen size points, from phones all the way up to pc screens. 
* To check all my paddings and margins look consistent and equal, I was able to do that via the DevTools. This helped me get the correct margins and paddings for my cards. 

Debugging
* Was able to show me where some of my incorrect variables were and point me in the direction to fix them.
* Within my JavaScript for my map I used console.log along my code to check that the arrays were being found correctly. 

## UX

### User Testing 
Once my project was almost complete I sent it out to friends and family to test. 

From sending out, There were some small changes needed within the design of the website. They felt like more information was needed within the home page and this is what sparked the video idea within that page. 

#### Further Testing
I tested my website on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers. I have also viewed it on different phones, andriods and Iphones aswell as different screen sizes varying from Ipads, laptops and desktops. From this testing I realised that my hero images where not loading correctly as my file path was incorrect, this has been fixed now and workign correctly.
